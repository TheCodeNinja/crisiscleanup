        <h3>Ready to Deploy</h3>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup may be deployed to any disaster, with or without a declaration. Local voluntary relief agencies (e.g. VOAD) or a government agency can request deployment. Please allow 6-24 business hours for setup.</p>

        <h3>Government Access</h3>

        <p>Crisis Cleanup helps organizations that <em>interact directly with survivors</em>, as they fix damaged property after a disaster. Crisis Cleanup must be useful to team leaders on the ground, <em>and</em> maintain the trust of the voluntary agencies.</p>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup information can be valuable to government. We must respect the privacy of clients and the wishes of local VOADs. Right now, government does not have access to Crisis Cleanup without an express invitation from the local VOAD.</p>
            <p><em>In the future (BUT NOT CURRENTLY)</em>, Crisis Cleanup will permit appropriately limited access to government. For example, City X in Texas doesn't need to see what's going on in City Y, in Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>See our <a href="https://crisiscleanup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200603007#requirements">full access policy</a>, and <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> if you have any questions.</p>

    <h4>Real Innovation</h4>
    <p>The real innovation of this system is the ability to coordinate tens of thousands of volunteers from dozens of organizations to thousands of sites after a disaster. Crisis Cleanup proves that it is possible to create a near frictionless technological platform where inter-organization Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration is not only convenient, but required.
    </p>

    <h4>Turnkey Solution</h4>
    <p>Crisis Cleanup free to reputable voluntary relief organizations, and can be deployed with 6-hours' notice (or less). There are no size or declaration requirements.</p>
